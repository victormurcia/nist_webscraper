This is a simple web scraper that allows one to extract thermodynamic information from the NIST Chemistry WebBook.

Simply provide a string correponding to the name of the compound you want information for and the program will return a pandas dataframe containing the enthalpy of formation in the gas phase if it is available for said compound.
